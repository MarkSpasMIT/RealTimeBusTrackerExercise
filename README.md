# RealTimeBusTrackerExercise

In thise exercise, again in the course of the MIT MERN Development program, we can indicate with a marker the real time position of buses and draw the route of a bus line from a city for which we have the necessary API. The API you can find on different public transport organisations and for the map on MapBox. 

## How to run

Download the index.html file with the animationmap.js and style.css. Edit the mapanimation.js in order to put your API Token from Mapbox by replacing the word "YOURAPITOKENHERE". Then open the index.html file. 

## Roadmap of future improvements

- add the location of the user, if available
- show with a specific pointer and if available, incidents/accidents.
